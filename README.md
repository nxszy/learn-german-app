## DEV UPDATES

#### Ep. 1
Due to the major kivymd update (from version 1.2 to 2.0.0) I decided to refactor the entire code written so far. Rewritting the features using new syntax in between existing code would be insanely time-consuming and frustrating. In addition i'll try to keep the project structure as well as the code itself - as clean and readable as I can.

#### Ep. 2
After a rather painful weekend app refactor is almost complete - only few screens missing.

#### Ep. 3
Using kivy and kivymd might not be the greatest idea I had. Writing an app, that is complex to say the least, is rather frustraiting. Moments before completing one of the parts of the project I ran into kivy.Clock issue. What that basically means is: there are too many widgets and too many diffrent task to handle for kivy to work on its basic clock speed. Tragedy.
