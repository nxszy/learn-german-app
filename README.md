Mobile/desktop app for learning german verbs - conjugation/rection/past forms. Also provides an easy way for teachers to give their students a test.

## DEV UPDATES

#### Ep. 1
Due to the major kivymd update (from version 1.2 to 2.0.0) I decided to refactor the entire code written so far. Rewritting the features using new syntax in between existing code would be insanely time-consuming and frustrating. In addition i'll try to keep the project structure as well as the code itself - as clean and readable as I can.
